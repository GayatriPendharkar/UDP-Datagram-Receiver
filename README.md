# UDP-Datagram-Receiver

LAB 3:

It includes data.txt, demo.sh, DES_Encryption.py, DES_Decryption.py, keys, README, UDPSender.py, UDPSenderClass.py, UDPReceiver.py, UDPReceiverClass.py 

Run the file -> 

1. To run the code from data file encryption to transmitting the encrypted file via UDP Datagram sender, receiving the 
   encrypted file via UDP Receiver and then decrypting the received file, please run the bash script demo.sh.
   
   Run the bash file as ./demo.sh

2. To see the inernal stages, please follow following instructions:

   (a) View the input data -> cat data.txt
   
   (b) Encrytion of the data file -> python DES_Encryption.py (name of the input file is hardcoded)
   
   (c) Sending the encrypted data over the UDP Datagram -> python UDPSender.py EncryptedFile source_IP dest_IP source_port dest_port datagram_file_name
   
   (d) Receiving the datagram -> python UDPReceiver.py source_IP dest_IP datagram_file_name
   
   (e) Decrypting the received data -> python DES_Decryption.py (name of file generated by UDPReceiver is hardcoded)
   
   (f) View the decrypted file -> cat DecryptedFile.txt
